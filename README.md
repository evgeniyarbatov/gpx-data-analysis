# Making use of GPX Data

I accumulated a lot of GPX files over the last 2-3 years of my running. I want to make sense of all this data. 

I think the current tools for creating maps and plotting heart rate are only scratching the surface of what should be possible. 

## Questions

Here is what I hope to find / confirm / look at:

- I think my average heart rate has declined over time
- I noticed patterns in my running: I tend to switch to walking when I get tired
- I want to predict my pace on the next day run given all the other runs I have done this week / month.
- I tend to run some of the routes more frequently than the others: find my favourite segments
- How does the watch accuracy change over the same segment on multiple attempts
- Can I reliably predict my marathon finish time given the shorter runs I do
- Last but not least: find inspiration for new runs and more exercise!

## What is here

- Experimenting with what is possible to do in [Data exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/evgeniyarbatov/gpx-data-analysis/blob/main/Data%20exploration.ipynb)
- Looking into a single run in [Deep dive into single run.ipynb](https://github.com/evgeniyarbatov/gpx-data-analysis/blob/main/Deep%20dive%20into%20single%20run.ipynb)
- Looking into multiple runs in [Deep dive multiple runs.ipynb](https://github.com/evgeniyarbatov/gpx-data-analysis/blob/main/Deep%20dive%20multiple%20runs.ipynb)
