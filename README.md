# Making use of GPX Data

I accumulated a lot of GPX files over the last 2-3 years of my running. I want to make sense of all this data. I think the current tools for creating maps and plotting heart rate are only scratching the surface of what should be possible. 

## Questions

Here are the quesions I hope to answer by looking at the data:

- I think my average heart rate has declined over time. 
  - Is it the case?
- I noticed patterns in my running: I tend to switch to walking when I get tired and make stops at traffic junctions. 
  - Can I identify these from data?
- I want to predict my pace on the next day run given all the other runs I have done this week / month
  - Can I do that reliably?
- I tend to run some of the routes more frequently than the others
  - Can I find my favouite segments from the last year?
- How is the watch accuracy over the same segment on multiple attempts
  - Are there noticable differences in how my location is recorded?
- Can I reliably predict my marathon finish time given the shorter runs I do? 
- Last but not least: find inspiration for new runs and more exercise!
